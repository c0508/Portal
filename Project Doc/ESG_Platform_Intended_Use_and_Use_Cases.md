# ESG Data Collection Platform â€” Intended Use and Detailed Scenarios

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Application

The ESG Data Collection Platform is designed to streamline the collection, organization, and analysis of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data from a diverse range of stakeholders. These stakeholders may include portfolio companies, suppliers, or internal business units depending on the organization initiating the request (e.g., private equity firms, large corporates, or ESG departments).

The platform supports structured data collection campaigns using customizable and versioned questionnaires that allow for tailored KPIs and reporting requirements depending on the respondentâ€™s profile (e.g., sector, geography, size).

## ðŸ‘¤ Primary Users and Stakeholder Types

1. **Private Equity / Debt Firms**
   - Collect ESG data from **portfolio companies**.
   - Use cases:
     - Define sector-specific ESG KPIs based on standards (e.g., SASB).
     - Launch periodic (e.g., annual or quarterly) campaigns.
     - Assign lead responder per company, who can delegate questions internally.
     - Compare ESG performance **across companies** and **over time**.

2. **Corporations and Supply Chain Managers**
   - Collect ESG data from **suppliers**.
   - Use cases:
     - Evaluate suppliers on corporate-level ESG qualifications (e.g., energy use, carbon footprint, certifications).
     - Request **product-specific ESG data**, like life cycle assessment (LCA) factors.
     - Segment suppliers and tailor questionnaires by geography, product type, or size.
     - Allow multiple users in each supplier organization to collaborate on answering.

3. **Internal Corporate ESG Departments**
   - Collect ESG data from **internal business units or facilities**.
   - Use cases:
     - Standardize data collection across sites.
     - Integrate with internal performance tracking and reporting cycles.
     - Delegate responsibility by topic or site (e.g., safety manager fills in workplace KPIs, energy manager fills in GHG data).

## âœ… Detailed Workflow per Use Case

### ðŸ“Œ Use Case 1: Private Equity Firm â†’ Portfolio Companies

- The PE firm defines ESG KPIs relevant to each companyâ€™s industry using a base template (e.g., SASB).
- The firm launches a campaign to all portfolio companies.
- Each company is assigned a **specific questionnaire version** based on its sector.
- A **lead responder** at each company receives the request, sees the full questionnaire, and can:
  - Answer questions directly
  - Delegate specific questions to other internal users (e.g., finance, HR, ops)
- Responses include both structured data (numerical) and supporting files (e.g., emissions reports).
- Upon completion, responses are submitted and locked.
- The PE firm compares ESG metrics across companies and tracks improvement over time.

### ðŸ“Œ Use Case 2: Corporation â†’ Suppliers

- The corporation sets up campaigns to gather ESG information from its suppliers.
- Questionnaires may include:
  - Corporate-level disclosures (GHG emissions, policies)
  - Product-level data (e.g., embodied carbon, recycled content)
- Each supplier receives a tailored questionnaire based on supplier classification (e.g., strategic, regional, product-type).
- Lead responder at the supplier can answer or delegate as needed.
- Data is collected with optional/required document uploads (e.g., ISO certifications, LCA sheets).
- Reminders are sent automatically or manually to improve response rates.
- The company reviews submissions, compares ESG performance across suppliers, and may request clarifications.

### ðŸ“Œ Use Case 3: Corporate ESG Team â†’ Internal Sites or Business Units

- ESG department launches data collection campaigns to internal business units.
- Questionnaire includes standardized KPIs (e.g., energy consumption, incidents, Scope 1â€“3 emissions).
- Each site is treated as a separate organization in the platform and may have multiple users.
- Delegation is supported within business units, enabling collaborative data entry.
- Submissions are locked once approved by the local site team.
- Headquarters reviews inputs for consistency and completeness, then aggregates results for sustainability reporting.

## ðŸ”’ Security and Access Needs Across All Scenarios

- **Each organization** (supplier, portfolio company, business unit) sees only their own data.
- Each user has access only to the data/questions they are responsible for.
- All activity is logged (who answered, delegated, uploaded, edited).
- Authentication via Microsoft or Google accounts (SSO), with fallback password login.
- Branding and customization supported per requesting organization.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Reporting and Outcome

- Time-series dashboards per entity (year-over-year improvement).
- Cross-entity benchmarking for standard KPIs.
- Exportable data for Power BI and third-party ESG tools.
- Change logs for traceability and audit purposes.
