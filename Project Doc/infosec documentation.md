When developing a web application in .NET with a Microsoft SQL Server database, several information security (infosec) documentation requirements should be considered to ensure compliance with security standards and best practices. Here are the key documentation requirements:

Security Policy:

Outline the overall security objectives and principles for the application.
Define roles and responsibilities related to security.

Risk Assessment:

Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
Document the risk management process, including risk mitigation strategies.

Architecture and Design Documentation:

Provide a detailed architecture diagram of the application, including components, data flow, and interactions.
Document security controls implemented in the design, such as authentication, authorization, and data encryption.

Data Classification and Handling:

Classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential).
Document data handling procedures, including data storage, transmission, and disposal.

Access Control Policy:

Define user roles and permissions for accessing the application and database.
Document the process for user provisioning and de-provisioning.

Authentication and Authorization:

Document the authentication mechanisms used (e.g., forms authentication, OAuth).
Describe the authorization process and any role-based access controls (RBAC) implemented.

Input Validation and Output Encoding:

Document input validation techniques to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
Outline output encoding practices to ensure safe data presentation.

Incident Response Plan:

Develop a plan for responding to security incidents, including detection, containment, eradication, and recovery.
Document communication protocols for reporting incidents.

Security Testing and Vulnerability Management:

Document the security testing strategy, including penetration testing and code reviews.
Outline the process for identifying, tracking, and remediating vulnerabilities.

Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:

Identify relevant compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and document how the application meets these requirements.

Training and Awareness:

Document training programs for developers and users on security best practices and awareness.

Change Management:

Outline the change management process for implementing security updates and patches.

Monitoring and Logging:

Document logging and monitoring practices to detect and respond to security events.
Specify log retention policies and access controls for logs.

Backup and Recovery Procedures:

Document backup strategies for the application and database, including frequency and storage locations.
Outline recovery procedures in case of data loss or corruption.

Third-Party Security:

Document security requirements for third-party services or libraries used in the application.

By maintaining comprehensive documentation in these areas, organizations can enhance the security posture of their .NET web applications and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.
