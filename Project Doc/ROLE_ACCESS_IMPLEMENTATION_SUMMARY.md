  - Complete view model support for all review operations
- **Updated navigation menus** with role-based review access:
  - "Review Management" for Lead Responders and higher

## **Implementation Details**

### **Role Hierarchy & Access Matrix**
```
PlatformAdmin    : Full system access, all menus, review management
OrgAdmin         : Organization management, create campaigns/questionnaires, review management
CampaignManager  : Create/manage campaigns, assign questionnaires, review management
LeadResponder    : Coordinate responses, delegate, assign reviewers, submit
Reviewer         : Review assigned responses, provide feedback, approve/reject
Responder        : Complete assigned questionnaires only
```

### **Menu Visibility Logic**
```razor
@* My Assignments - visible to ALL authenticated users *@
<a asp-controller="Response" asp-action="Index">My Assignments</a>

@* Full menu only for management roles *@
@if (User.IsInRole("PlatformAdmin") || User.IsInRole("OrgAdmin") || User.IsInRole("CampaignManager"))
{
    <!-- Questionnaires, Campaigns menus -->
}

@* Delegation and Review features for leads and higher *@
@if (User.IsInRole("PlatformAdmin") || User.IsInRole("OrgAdmin") || 
     User.IsInRole("CampaignManager") || User.IsInRole("LeadResponder"))
{
    <!-- Delegations, Question Assignments, Review Management menus -->
}

@* Reviewer interface *@
@if (User.IsInRole("Reviewer"))
{
    <!-- My Reviews menu -->
}
```

### **Review System Data Flow**
```
1. Lead Responder assigns reviewers using ReviewController.AssignReviewer
2. ReviewService creates ReviewAssignment records with audit logging
3. Reviewers access MyReviews to see assigned review tasks
4. Reviewers use ReviewQuestions interface to review responses
5. ReviewService manages comments, status changes, and workflow
6. Complete audit trail maintained in ReviewAuditLog
```

## **Access Control Validation Results**

### **Menu Visibility Testing** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
| Role | My Assignments | Questionnaires | Campaigns | Delegations | Reviews | Admin |
|------|----------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Responder | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
